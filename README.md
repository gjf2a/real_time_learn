## Synopsis

This project archives the research I did with my student Eric Huynh
during the summer of 2016. It was forked from my project ev3learner to
accommodate our agenda. It has subsequently been forked by the following 
projects:

E-R-C/FLAIRS30-BSOC: This is the project we reference in our publication
from the summer work. We removed files that were not relevant to the
published work, to make it easier to navigate.

csci235spr17: That project used a lot of the code developed herein in 
support of my Intelligent Robotics course in Spring 2017. Our research 
for summer 2017 is also housed in that project.
